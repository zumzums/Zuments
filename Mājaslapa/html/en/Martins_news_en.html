Class 6c went on a study tour to Riga on October 14.
		</p>
		<img src="../../image/6c-eksk.jpg">
		<p>
		Arriving at the VEF Culture Palace, we were greeted by the museum manager Dace and guide Mark. Since it was not possible to understand when it would start raining, after disinfecting <br> hands, we went to the territory of the former VEF factory. According to the guide, the children had to look for VEF buildings, <br> take photos with them. Returning to the VEF Culture Palace, we got a comprehensive account of the castle's renovation works, tried out the light effects in the lobby, and found out where the president is sitting in the hall when he arrives for a concert at the castle. We also learned a lot about what VEF produced, how to send telegrams, how to make a landline call, looked at different types of ancient radio, and, of course, saw a VEF Minox camera made in Latvia. Each was given a cardboard radio model that can be created at home. <br>
The second part of the tour was a lesson at the Latvian National Museum of History on the Latvian so-called Prehistoric time. We were able to walk around and see the Stone, Bronze and Iron Age exhibits (the ABCs of history), as well as complete the task of assembling various objects in the ABC time zone. <br>
"Many thanks to the parents of 6th grade for their support! During the tour we often disinfected our hands and used protective masks. It was very valuable to learn something new and interesting, to strengthen new knowledge in Latvian history and to think about the culture of behavior in the museum, both to enjoy time with classmates outside of school, "sums up the day spent by class teacher Gunta Lagzdiņa.

School Speech Contest for 4th - 6th Grade Students </b> (October 15)
		</p>
		<p>
		On October 9, the school round of the 4th - 6th grade speech competition took place. This time, none of the 25 poems were repeated, <br> the students also told in a few sentences about the chosen poet. The most popular authors of young people's choice are M.Cielēna, P.Brūveris, <br> I.Zandere, O.Vācietis, L.Briedis, I.Ziedonis and others. The most surprising, however, was the discovery of young poets - students who performed <br> self-written poems. And the most interesting is how they were made - watching the clouds… In a Latvian language lesson, the students watched the clouds outside, everyone saw something in them and then created a poem. When asked if it "came" hard for young poets, the answers were <br> varied. It is to be hoped that we will soon be able to read a selection of poetry from Salaspils Secondary School No. 1.
		</p>
		<p>
		The best in the 4th grade group - Mārtiņš Razgals (1st place), Tomass Sperga (2nd place), Edvarts Slūka (3rd place).
		</p>
		<p>
		Best in 5th grade group - Katrīna Kravčuka (1st place), Kate Circāne (2nd place), Alise Agnese Megne (3rd place).

		Good Work Week 2020 </b> (October 8)
		</p>
		<p>
		The charity organization Palīdzēsim.lv has been organizing the campaign “Good Works Week” for the twelfth year in a row, when increased attention is paid to assistance, the provision of which does not require a large financial investment.
		</p>
		<p>
		5th grade students of Salaspils Secondary School No. 1 are also participating in this campaign for the second year together with their parents, but for educator Dace <br> Kontrimiene this is the fifth year when gifts are given to lonely people in Salaspils in the first weeks of October. <br>
Thanks to the employees of the Salaspils social service, the groomed gifts reach the recipients.
		</p>
		<img src="../../image/labidarbi5e.jpg">
		<p>
		Children and their parents always respond to the call, so it is good to realize that helping, delighting, and making gifts is a joy for young and old alike.
		</p>
		<p>Why do children participate in Good Work Week?
Dita: Help others and others will help you! <br>
Kate: Maybe we'll be lonely someday and such gifts will make us happy! <br>
Eliza: No matter what gift, it's important to bring joy. <br>
</p>
<p>
The children emphasized that charity as a form of assistance is important and necessary, it creates pleasant emotions for both recipients and donors. It is nice to realize that we are able to create a surprise for our fellow human beings, our countrymen.
         </p>
		 <p>
		 
Educator Dace: Doing good deeds, participating in charity events is a great way to inform and educate both yourself and your loved ones on various issues that we do not talk about enough on a daily basis. It makes you think about various social <br> injustices and natural disasters, about other people who are not as lucky as us, about old age, about their loved ones, about the fact that an ordinary call can change lives ...
